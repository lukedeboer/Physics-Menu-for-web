# Physics-Menu-for-web
I made a 3d menu for websites using three js and cannon.js. When a menu item is clicked on, force is applied to the physics object and the word will blow apart. as the physics is being applied to the object, a redirect to a new link on the website will occur.
This code also allows people to import their own fonts. I am using helvetica at the moment. Please be aware that to using your own fonts will change how the objects will be have in the simulated physics environment. 
I haven't touched this code since over a year ago and have no further interest in advancing the project as I am engaged in full time work.
